## Scaffold

Another clean Wordpress starter theme so we don't have to repeat ourselves.

**Version:** 0.1  
**Requires:** 3.0+  

## Benefits

The goal of Scaffold is to make the life of Wordpress developers easier. This is done by a clean setup of the theme files, handy hooks in functions.php and a Scaffold class to handle all advanced logic, like the Customizer.
